        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "One long-standing challenge for Collaborative Filtering (CF) based recommendation methods is the cold start problem, i.e., to provide recommendations for new users or items who have no historical interaction record. The cold start problem is common in real world applications. For example, 500 hours of new videos are uploaded to YouTube every minute, 500,000 new users register in Facebook every day, and web/mobile apps face the daily challenge of onboarding new users and subscribers. To provide recommendations for these new users and items, many content-based methods and heuristic methods have been deployed, e.g., recommending popular items or geographically near items. However, recent research efforts that tackle the cold start problem from the perspective of machine learning have made promising strides.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cold start happens when new users or new items arrive in e-commerce platforms. Classic recommender systems like collaborative filtering assumes that each user or item has some ratings so that we can infer ratings of similar users/items even if those ratings are unavailable. However, for new users/items, this becomes hard because we have no browse, click or purchase data for them. As a result, we cannot “fill in the blank” using typical matrix factorization techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recommender systems can be generally classified as collaborative filter-based, content-based, or hybrid systems. Collaborative filter-based systems estimate user responses by collecting preference information from numerous users. The predictions are built upon the existing ratings of other users who have similar ratings as the target user. However, such systems cannot handle new users (user cold-start) and new items (item cold-start) because of the lack of user-item interactions. Content-based systems are introduced to solve the cold-start problem. Such systems use user profile information (e.g., gender, nationality, religion, and political stance) and the contents of the items to make recommendations. The systems might have a limitation suggesting the same items to the users who have similar contents regardless of items that user already rated. Hybrid systems, which are based on a collaborative filter and utilize content information, are widely used in various applications. However, these systems are unfit for a recommendation when the user-item interaction data are sparse. Moreover, due to privacy issues, collecting personal information is challenging, which might result in the user cold-start problem. To avoid the user cold-start problem due to privacy issues, many web-based systems, such as Netflix, recommend items based on only minimal user information. Netflix initially presents popular movies and television programs to new users: we call these videos the evidence candidates. Then, the user chooses the videos that he/she likes among the candidates. Afterward, the system recommends some programs based on the videos selected by the user. Recently, to improve performance, the recommendations have been made using deep learning methods; however, the cold-start problem remains for new users who rate only a few items.\n",
        "\n",
        "Matrix completion is a classic problem underlying recommender systems. It is traditionally tackled with matrix factorization. Recently, deep learning based methods, especially graph neural networks, have made impressive progress on this problem. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods focus on modeling the user-item interaction graph. The inherent drawback of such methods is that their performance is bound to the density of the interactions, which is however usually of high sparsity. More importantly, for a cold start user/item that does not have any interactions, such methods are unable to learn the preference embedding of the user/item since there is no link to this user/item in the graph.\n",

        "- [Treating cold start in product search by priors](https://www.amazon.science/publications/treating-cold-start-in-product-search-by-priors) - New products in e-commerce platforms suffer from cold start, both in recommendation and search. In this study, we present experiments to deal with cold start in search by predicting priors for behavioral features in learning to rank set up. The offline results show that our technique generates priors for behavioral features that closely track posterior values. The online A/B test on 140MM queries shows that treatment with priors improves new products impressions and increased customers engagement pointing to their relevance and quality.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Representative approaches for cold-start recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "`TL;DR` use subset of items and users that represents the population\n",
        "\n",
        "If we do not have enough information about users and items, we can rely more on those who “represent” the set of items and users. That’s the philosophy behind representative based methods. Representatives can be users whose linear combinations of preferences accurately approximate other users’.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Random Strategy**\n",
        "\n",
        "A naive method to choose the representatives is simply to randomly select a subset of users or items. This strategy corresponds to the assumption that users or items are indifferent in terms of their predictive power on other users’ and items’ ratings and therefore there would be no gain in strategically choosing which users and items to elicit ratings from.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Most Ratings Strategy**\n",
        "\n",
        "Another simple method to select the representative is to choose the k users or k items which had the most observed ratings. This strategy is also easy to calculate. However, popularity in many cases are not equivalent to informativeness. For example, the most popular movies tend to be widely liked by almost any user and a rating on such movies would provide little information regarding the new user’s unique preferences. Similarly, a very active user may be someone who frequently watches randomly selected movies and may not serve as a good user prototype.\n",
        "\n",
        "**K-Medoids Strategy**\n",
        "\n",
        "The previous two methods do not consider the correlation between the selected representatives and could potentially choose multiple highly similar users or items. To avoid such redundancy problem, we also consider another more complicated strategy based on k-medoids clustering. k-medoids tries to group data objects into k clusters. Each cluster is represented by an actual data object, i.e. the representative. The other instances are clustered with the representative to which it is most similar to.\n",
        "\n",
        "A famous representative based method, *[Representative Based Matrix Factorization (RBMF)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2043932.2043943)* is an extension of MF methods with an additional constraint that **m** items should be represented by a linear combination of **k** items, as can be seen from the objective function below:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\min_{U,V} ||R-UV||_F^2 + \\alpha||V||_F^2\\ s.t.\\ U \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}\\ and\\ U \\sub_{n,k}\\mathbb{R}, V \\sub \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times m}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, we have the reconstruction error similar to standard MF methods, with this additional constraint. When a new user joins the platform, we can ask the new users to rate these $k$ items, and use that to infer the ratings of other $m − k$ items. This way, with a small additional cost on users of rating some items, we can improve the recommendations for new users.\n",
        "\n",
        "In most real world systems, new items and new users would be added to the system constantly. A recommender system should be able to adjust its model rapidly in order to be able to make recommendations regarding new users and new items as soon as possible. This require techniques for learning the parameters associated with new users and new items based on an increment of new data without the need to retrain the whole model entirely. This type of techniques have also been known as ***folding in***. Using the RBMF model, folding in is effortless. In particular, we only need to obtain ratings from the $k$ representative users for a new item in order to recommend it to other users. Similarly, we only need to ask a new user to rate $k$ representative items to recommend other items to him.\n",
        "\n",
        "There have been improvements on RBMF proposed in [this](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3108148) paper, where we can interview only a subset of users instead of all the new users to decrease the burden on the new users. The advantage of this approach is that there is more interpretability, because new users can be expressed in terms of few representative items. Also, If you’re using MF methods already, this can be a simple extension to handle cold start. Possible disadvantage is that might be a need to change UI and front end logic to ask the users to rate the representative items.\n",

        "### Auxiliary information transformation\n",
        "\n",
        "`TL;DR` utilizes auxiliary information.\n",
        "\n",
        "ML-based models combine user-item interactions from existing warm start users and items (as in CF-based methods) with auxiliary information from both warm and cold users and items (as in content-based methods). This auxiliary information – be it from user profiles, item descriptions, reviews, and other sources – is often readily available even in the absence of user-item interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are various kinds of auxiliary information could be exploited to improve cold-start recommendation performance, e.g., user attributes, item attributes, knowledge graphs, samples in an auxiliary domain, etc.\n",

        "(a) setup of cold start recommendation problem, where both warm and cold users and items have auxiliary representations (such as user profiles and item content); and (b) the main idea of existing cold start recommendation algorithms: learn transformation functions to transform auxiliary representations to CF representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key insight is to learn two transformation functions – one for users and one for items – to transform the auxiliary representations of these new users and items into the CF space. The learned transformation functions are then applied on auxiliary representations of cold start users and items to predict preference scores at inference time. Hence, the fundamental challenge is how to generate effective transformation functions based on the given auxiliary information and user-item interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recent ML-based approaches have made promising strides versus traditional methods. These ML approaches typically combine both user-item interaction data of existing warm start users and items (as in CF-based methods) with auxiliary information of users and items such as user profiles and item content information (as in content-based methods). However, such approaches face key drawbacks including the error superimposition issue that the auxiliary-to-CF transformation error increases the final recommendation error; the ineffective learning issue that long distance from transformation functions to model output layer leads to ineffective model learning; and the unified transformation issue that applying the same transformation function for different users and items results in poor transformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recommender systems have been widely deployed in various online services, such as E-commerce platforms and news portals, to address the issue of information overload for users. At their core, they typically adopt collaborative filtering, aiming to estimate the likelihood of a user adopting an item based on the interaction history like past purchases and clicks. However, the interaction data of new users or new items are often very sparse, leading to the so-called cold-start scenarios in which it becomes challenging to learn effective user or item representations.\n",

        "\n",
        "`TL;DR` designing a decision making strategy. consider the exploration vs exploitation tradeoffs in new items.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a new user joins the system it initially has no knowledge of the preferences of the user and so would like to quickly learn these. The recommender system therefore initially starts in an “exploration” phase where the first few items that it asks the new user to rate are chosen with the aim of discovering the user’s preferences. Cold-start problem can also be naturally modeled as a CMAB problem. Multi-armed bandit problem (MAB) which derives from the gamble game is a simplified setting of reinforcement learning. In order to earn the maximal sum of rewards, the gambler has two choices, one is trying to play some new arms of the multi-armed bandit which may have higher reward (exploration), while the other is sticking on playing the arm (exploitation) given the high reward so far.\n",
        "\n",
        "In particular, upper confidence bound (UCB) is an effective method to solve CMAB, which suggests an arm with maximal confidence upper bound. LinUCB extends UCB by considering contextual information about the arm. To recommend diversified items, suggests a batch of items (called super arm) to each user with an entropy regularization.\n",

        "\n",
        "`TL;DR` few-shot meta-learners. \n",
        "\n",
        "A common challenge for most current recommender systems is the cold-start problem. Due to the lack of user-item interactions, the fine-tuned recommender systems are unable to handle situations with new users or new items. Recently, some works introduce the meta-optimization idea into the recommendation scenarios, i.e. predicting the user preference by only a few of past interacted items. The core idea is learning a global sharing initialization parameter for all users and then learning the local parameters for each user separately. However, most meta-learning based recommendation approaches adopt model-agnostic meta-learning for parameter initialization, where the global sharing parameter may lead the model into local optima for some users.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although recommendation systems have been proved to play a significant role in a variety of applications, there are two long-standing obstacles that greatly limit the performance of recommendation systems. On the one hand, the number of user-item interaction records often tends to be small and is insufficient to mine user interests well, which is called the data sparsity problem. On the other hand, for any service, there are constantly new users joining, for whom there are no historical interaction records. Traditional recommendation systems cannot make recommendations to these users, which is called the cold-start problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "As more and more users begin to interact with more than one domains (e.g., music and book), it increases opportunities of leveraging information collected from other domains to alleviate the two problems (i.e., data sparsity and cold-start problems) in one domain. This idea leads to Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) which has attracted increasing attention in recent years.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two core issues for cross-domain recommendation, namely, what to transfer and how to transfer. What to transfer is how to mine useful knowledge in each domain, and how to transfer focuses on how to establish linkages between domains and realize the transfer of knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cold-start problems are enormous challenges in practical recommender systems. One promising solution for this problem is cross-domain recommendation (CDR) which leverages rich information from an auxiliary (source) domain to improve the performance of recommender system in the target domain. In these CDR approaches, the family of Embedding and Mapping methods for CDR (EMCDR) is very effective, which explicitly learn a mapping function from source embeddings to target embeddings with overlapping users.\n",

        "With the help of the auxiliary (source) domain, cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is a promising solution to alleviate data sparsity and the cold-start problem in the target domain.

CST utilizes the user embedding in the source domain to initialize the embedding in the target domain and restricts them from being closed. In recent years, researchers proposed many deep learning-based models to enhance knowledge transfer. CoNet transfers and combines the knowledge by using cross-connections between feedforward neural networks. MINDTL combines the CF information of the target-domain with the rating patterns extracted from a cluster-level rating matrix in the source-domain. DDTCDR develops a novel latent orthogonal mapping to extract user preferences over multiple domains while preserving relations between users across different latent spaces.

        "4. Gradient-based approaches: learning an shared initialization where the model parameters can be trained via a few gradient updates on new tasks. Most meta-learning models follow an episodic learning manner. Among them, MAML is one of the most popular frameworks, which falls into the fourth type. Some MAML-based works consider that the sequence of tasks may originate from different task distributions, and try various task-specific adaptations to improve model capability.\n",

        "\n",
        "This line of research aims to learn a model which can adapt and generalize to new tasks and new environments with a few training samples. To achieve the goal of “learning-to-learn”, there are three types of different approaches. Metric-based methods are based on a similar idea to the nearest neighbors algorithm with a well-designed metric or distance function, prototypical networks or Siamese Neural Network. Model-based methods usually perform a rapid parameter update with an internal architecture or are controlled by another meta-learner model. As for the optimization-based approaches, by adjusting the optimization algorithm, the models can be efficiently updated with a few examples.\n",

        "\n",
        "Most meta-learning recommenders are built upon the well-known framework of model-agnostic meta learning (MAML), aiming to learn a parameter initialization where a few steps of gradient updates will lead to good performances on the new tasks. A typical assumption here is the recommendations of different users are highly relevant. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in actual scenarios. When the users exhibit different purchase intentions, the task relevance among them is actually very weak, which makes it problematic to find a shared parameter initialization optimal for all users.

        "Inspired by the significant improvements of meta learning, the pioneering work of [Vartak et. al.](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46346.pdf) provides a meta-learning strategy to solve cold-start problems. It uses a task-dependent way to generate the varying biases of decision layers for different tasks, but it is prone to underfitting and is not flexible enough to handle various recommendation scenarios. [MeLU](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00413) adopts the framework of MAML. Specifically, it divides the model parameters into two groups, i.e., the personalized parameter and the embedding parameter. The personalized parameter is characterized as a fully-connected DNN to estimate user preferences. The embedding parameter is referred as the embeddings of users and items learned from side-information. An inner-outer loop is used to update these two groups of parameters. In the inner loop, the personalized parameter is locally updated via the prediction loss of support set in current task. In the outer loop, these parameters are globally updated according to the prediction loss of query sets in multiple tasks. Through the fashion of local-global update, MeLU can provide a shared initialization for different tasks. The later work [MetaCS](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Meta-Learning-for-User-Cold-Start-Recommendation-Bharadhwaj/f3135b553f592dc42d4202c90739c99486103fc3) is much similar to MeLU, and the main difference is that the local-global update involves all parameters from input embedding to model prediction. To generalize well for different tasks, [MetaHIN](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/accepted-papers/view/meta-learning-on-heterogeneous-information-networks-for-cold-start-recommen) and [MAMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03183) propose different task-specific adaptation strategies. In particular, MetaHIN incorporates heterogeneous information networks (HINs) into MAML to capture rich semantics of meta-paths. MAMO introduces two memory matrices based on user profiles: a feature-specific memory that provides a specific bias term for the shared parameter initialization; a task-specific memory that guides the model for predictions. However, these two gradient-based meta-learning models may still suffer from potential training issues in MAML, and the model-level innovations of them are closely related with side-information, which limits their application scenarios.\n",

        "\n",
        "Though quite a few cold-start recommendation methods have been proposed, most require side information or knowledge from other domains during training, and commonly treat the user-item interactions in a static way. In contrast, cold-start sequential recommendation targets a setting where no additional auxiliary knowledge can be accessed due to privacy issues, and more importantly, the user-item interactions are sequentially dependent. A user’s preferences and tastes may change over time and such dynamics are of great significance in sequential recommendation. Hence, it is necessary to develop a new sequential recommendation framework that can distill short-range item transitional dynamics, and make fast adaptation to those cold-start users with limited user-item interactions.\n",

As a result, existing sequential recommendation models will lose their predictive power due to the difficulties in learning sequential patterns over users with only limited interactions. In this work, we aim to improve sequential recommendation for cold-start users with a novel framework named MetaTL, which learns to model the transition patterns of users through meta-learning.\n",

More recently, TransRec embeds items in a “transition space” and learns a translation vector for each user. With the advance in neural networks, many different neural structures including Recurrent Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers and Graph Neural Networks, have been adopted to model the dynamic preferences of users over their behavior sequences. While these methods aim to improve the overall performance via representation learning for sequences, they suffer from weak prediction power for cold-start users with short behavior sequences.\n",

        "This line of research aims to learn a model which can adapt and generalize to new tasks and new environments with a few training samples. To achieve the goal of “learning-to-learn”, there are three types of different approaches. Metric-based methods are based on a similar idea to the nearest neighbors algorithm with a well-designed metric or distance function, prototypical networks or Siamese Neural Network. Model-based methods usually perform a rapid parameter update with an internal architecture or are controlled by another meta-learner model. As for the optimization-based approaches, by adjusting the optimization algorithm, the models can be efficiently updated with a few examples.\n",

        "cold-start sequential recommendation targets a setting where no additional auxiliary knowledge can be accessed due to privacy issues, and more importantly, the user-item interactions are sequentially dependent. A user’s preferences and tastes may change over time and such dynamics are of great significance in sequential recommendation. Hence, it is necessary to develop a new sequential recommendation framework that can distill short-range item transitional dynamics, and make fast adaptation to those cold-start users with limited user-item interactions.\n",

Each item is mapped to a trainable embedding associated with its ID. There is no auxiliary information for users or items. In sequential recommendation, given the sequence of items ${𝑆𝑒𝑞}_𝑢 = (𝑖_{𝑢,1},𝑖_{𝑢,2}, \\dots,𝑖_{𝑢,𝑛})$ that user 𝑢 has interacted with in chronological order, the model aims to infer the next interesting item $𝑖_{𝑢,𝑛+1}$.

To enable meta-learning in sequential recommendation for cold-start users, we formulate training a sequential recommender as solving a new few-shot learning problem (i.e., meta-testing task) by training on many sampled similar tasks (i.e., the meta-training tasks). Each task includes a 𝑠𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 set S and a 𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑟𝑦 set Q, which can be regarded as the “training” set and “testing” set of the task. For example, while constructing a task $T_𝑛$, given user $𝑢_𝑗$ with initial interactions in sequence (e.g., $𝑖_𝐴 \\rightarrow_{u_j} i_B \\rightarrow_{u_j} i_C$), we will have the a set of transition pairs $\\{ 𝑖_𝐴 \\rightarrow_{u_j} i_B, i_B \\rightarrow_{u_j} i_C \\}$ as support and predict for the query $i_C \\rightarrow_{u_j} ?$.\n",

        "After calculating the overall proximity between two nodes, it becomes a natural choice to build a k-NN graph as adopted in (Monti, Bronstein, and Bresson 2017). Such a method will keep a fixed number of neighbors once the graph is constructed.\n",

        "In the constructed attribute graph $\\mathcal{A}_u$ and $\\mathcal{A}_i$, each nodes has an attached multi-hot attribute encoding and a unique one-hot representation denoting its identity. Due to the huge number of users and items in the web-scale recommender systems, the dimensionality of nodes’ one-hot representation is extremely high. Moreover, the multi-hot attribute representation simply combines multiple types of attributes into one long vector without considering their interactive relations. The goal of interaction layer is to reduce the dimensionality for one-hot identity representation and learn the high-order attribute interactions for multi-hot attribute representation. To this end, we first set up a lookup table to transform a node’s one-hot representation into the low-dimensional dense vector. The lookup layers correspond to two parameter matrices $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M×D}$ and $N \\in \\mathbb{R}^{ N×D}$. Each entry $m_u \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ and $n_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^D$ encodes the user $u$’s preference and the item $i$’s property, respectively. Note that $m_u$ and $n_i$ for cold start nodes are meaningless, since no interaction is observed to train their preference embedding. Inspired by (He and Chua 2017), we capture the high-order attribute interactions with a ***Bi-Interactive pooling operation***, in addition to the linear combination operation.\n",

        "Intuitively, different neighbors have different relations to a node. Furthermore, one neighbor usually has multiple attributes. For example, in a social network, a user’s neighborhood may consist of classmates, family members, colleagues, and so on, and each neighbor may have several attributes such as age, gender, and occupation. Since all these attributes (along with the preferences) are now encoded in the node’s embedding, it is necessary to pay different attentions to different dimensions of the neighbor node’s embedding. However, existing GCN (Kipf and Welling 2017) or GAT (Veliˇckovi´c et al. 2018) structures cannot do this because they are at the coarse granularity. GCN treats all neighbors equally and GAT differentiates the importance of neighbors at the node level. To solve this problem, we design a gated-GNN structure to aggregate the fine-grained neighbor information.\n",
